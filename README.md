##SupV - A simple supervisor for processes.

### Why?
Service Manager, Task Scheduler and IIS are all a bit rubbish in their own individual ways. SupV won't fix that but may provide a light weight option that is somewhat different. Loosely inspired by the excellent [supervisord.](http://supervisord.org/)

*Status*: functional, ultra pre-alpha.

*Needs*: requirements - how should it be configured? monitored? Should it be distributed? Should it have pull deployment capabilities?
